#### 
Placement module of the ETSO Framework
####


In this guide, we show how to customize the placement module `"placement.py" <placement.py>`_ to deal with a specific resource placement algorithm available in the placement package `"placementAlgo.jar" <placementAlgo.jar>`_. 
Then we describe the inputs and output of the placement algorithms and show how we can add and package a new one. A dummy algorithm was developed to easily integrate a new algorithm in the ETSO framework.
